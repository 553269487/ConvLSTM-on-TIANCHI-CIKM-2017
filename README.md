# Easy-Use-ConvLSTM and ConvGRU-for-beginners
## **Who are supposed to read this repo** A rookie modified ConvLSTM source code

Rookies in deep learning who mistakenly plan to use ConvLSTM for final year project (just like me) or something. Anyone who are familiared with CNN and LSTM will find this repo valueless.

This repo provide a shortpath on how to use the current source code on your dataset. There are some redundant codes because I am also a rookie.

## Other repo
Majority of code comes from https://github.com/jhhuang96/ConvLSTM-PyTorch.

https://github.com/holmdk/Video-Prediction-using-PyTorch also deploy ConvLSTM by Pytorch-lighting. The codes of models are much more concise and understandable for beginners.
